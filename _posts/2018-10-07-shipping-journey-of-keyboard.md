This is a picture of my [new keyboard][uhk-link]. It is super-nerdy and a lot of fun.
It (obviously) splits in half and everything is remappable, extendable, and generally very hackable.

This was shipped as part of a crowd-sourced project, and so I had to wait for
two years after ordering for it to arrive. As a result, when the supplier told me it had
shipped, I tracked it pretty closely, and the results were surprising. I drew a map of its
path to Montreal:

As I'd ordered from [Crowd Supply][crowdsupply-link], I was prepared for the keyboard's
flight straight over Montreal to Portland, Oregon. What I was not prepared for was the
detour to Salluit.

Salluit is the second-northernmost settlement in all of Quebec. It has a population of
1,483. If you don't believe me you can check [on wikipedia][salluit-wiki]. This is
Salluit:

A friend thinks this was probably a bug in the courier's tracking software, but I really
hope it wasn't. If you're going to have to wait a long time for a package, it's at least
nice to see as strange and unpredictable a shipment route as possible.

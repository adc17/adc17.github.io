### About Me

I'm a developer at [Busbud](https://www.busbud.com/), and I'm very 
happy to be part of their team! We use a full javascript stack, 
and I work mostly in the backend.

In my spare time I focus on statically-typed functional languages 
and the mathsy side of programming. 

My main interests are currently 
Haskell and TLA+. If you haven't heard of TLA+, the intro to Leslie 
Lamport's video course is a great place to [learn more](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/videos.html).

The photo is of me, my wife, and our dog, in Montr√©al, where we all live.
